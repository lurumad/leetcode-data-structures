# Graphs

A graph is any collection of nodes and connections between those nodes.

## Graph terminology

`Edges` of a node can either be:
 - directed: means that you can only traverse in one direction (tree graphs)
 - undirected: means you can traverse in both directions.

`Connected component` of a graph is a group of nodes that are connected by edges.

Nodes that are connected by an edge are called `neighbors`

A graph can be a `cyclic` or `acyclic`

## Graphs BFS

There are some problems where using BFS is clearly better than using DFS: `shortest path`
